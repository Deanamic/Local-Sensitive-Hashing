As 19 of 20 world leaders pledged to fight climate change, President Trump remained the sole holdout. World leaders met in Buenos Aires for the G20 meeting to discuss, in part, trade agreements and the Paris Agreement.

The meeting came just a few days after President Trump sat down to an interview with the Washington Post. On the topic of climate change, Trump reasoned his disbelief of his own administration's climate report due to his "very high levels of intelligence."

This was in response to the 1,600 page National Climate Assessment, released on Black Friday detailing the federal governments most up to date analysis on the state of climate change in the United States. Over 300 federal and non-federal experts and 13 federal agencies contributed to the overall assessment.

From drought in the Colorado River to extreme rainfall in the Midwest and forest fires in California, the report identifies examples of how climate change is impacting everyday lives of Americans. The report focuses on how future climate change will impact communities and individuals, noting that the most vulnerable Americans will be most impacted.
