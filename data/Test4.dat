I called my wife from the road and told her that the sales were slow and I was going to cross the state line into Nebraska and try to open some new territory and we exchanged I love yous and I miss yous and then I had to feign cell trouble when I heard the shower shut off and the bathroom door open as Mandy walked into the bedroom and I asked her if she thought she should call her husband and she said, “Silly-Willy,” and then jumped me while our cell phones vibrated side by side on the dresser.
